        Minions is a spinoff and prequel to Despicable Me and Despicable Me 2, but instead of focusing on Steve Carell's Gru, it puts the spotlight on the Minions alone. Set in the late 1960s, the movie follows three Minions as they search for a new evil boss to rule their species. The quest takes them to a villain convention in Florida and, soon after, all around the world.They are small and yellow and each have unique traits in order to tell them apart including the number of eyes, height, hair, clothing, roundness, and size of their pupils.

      The fairy tale of Cinderella has a rep for being a bit retrograde. It’s a story about a girl whose passivity and meekness in the face of abuse is rewarded by a fairy godmother who hands her over to a man, goes the usual criticism. It’s the story of a girl who can’t even make it to a party without magical help.

      An arrogant young prince (Robby Benson) and his castle's servants fall under the spell of a wicked enchantress, who turns him into the hideous Beast until he learns to love and be loved in return. The spirited, headstrong village girl Belle (Paige O'Hara) enters the Beast's castle after he imprisons her father Maurice (Rex Everhart). With the help of his enchanted servants, including the matronly Mrs. Potts (Angela Lansbury), Belle begins to draw the cold-hearted Beast out of his isolation. It was a good movie because And that beauty has nothing to do with physical appearance. It has to do with the heart. Belle is beautiful because she is kind, thoughtful, funny and smart.
